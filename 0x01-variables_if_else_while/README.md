## Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

-This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

### 1. The last digit

-This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

-Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

-You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
-All your code should be in the main function
-You can only use putchar twice in your code

### 3. alphABET

-Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
-You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
-All your code should be in the main function
-You can only use putchar three times in your code

### 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

-Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
-Print all the letters except q and e
-You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
-All your code should be in the main function
-You can only use putchar twice in your code

### 5. Numbers

-Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
-All your code should be in the main function

### 6. Numberz

-Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
-You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
-You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
-You can only use putchar twice in your code
-All your code should be in the main function

### 7. Smile in the mirror

-Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
-You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
-All your code should be in the main function
-You can only use putchar twice in your code

### 8. Hexadecimal

-Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
-You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
-All your code should be in the main function
-You can only use putchar three times in your code

### 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success

-Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
-Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
-Numbers should be printed in ascending order
-You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
-All your code should be in the main function
-You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code
-You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
